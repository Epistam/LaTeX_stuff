# LaTeX stuff

## What's this ?
This repo will host the various tools, utils, templates and macros I use in
LaTeX. Who knows, they might be useful to someone at some point. Quite
evidently, you should feel free (and more than welcome) to clone this repo and
tweak these files to your own liking. I'm in no way a LaTeX expert, and to be
fair, I'm eager to learn more by going through whatever you can come up with.

## What's *this* ?
- `Makefile` : my go-to Makefile for compiling generic LaTeX documents. I have
  other more complex ones for more specific applications which I may or may not
  push here.
